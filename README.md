# hiragana-reader
okay, my actual first neural network. still learning to program! but i want to make a little program that can read the basic 46 hiragana (and the variants of sa and ki).

i'm excited! i don't really know anything about how any of this works yet, but i love to learn and i really want to get into this stuff

since i wasn't able to get this program hosted on a server or anything, it just runs on localhost port 10000
